# DDEV AI

## Overview

This add-on integrates commonly necessary AI services into your [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) project.

- Milvus for Vector Database

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get lpeabody/ddev-ai
ddev restart
# You may also need to chown the .ddev directory recursively as some services
# are configured to map data volumes in the DDEV directory.
# sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .ddev/milvus
```

After installation, make sure to commit the `.ddev` directory to version control.

## Usage

| Command               | Description                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `ddev describe`       | View service status and used ports for AI services |
| `ddev logs -s milvus` | Check Milvus logs                                  |

### Profiles

Over time we will likely add support for a variety of AI services. Each unique
product might require several services to work together, such as Milvus. This
addon leverages the profiles feature from DDEV 1.24+ in order to group related
services together. See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-compose-files/#optional-services.

Most of the time you will need to use the profiles flag to start the services
you want to use:

- Milvus: `ddev start --profiles='milvus'`

#### Default Profile Set

You can use a default set of profiles by setting `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `.ddev/.env`, for example:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=milvus
```

After `ddev restart`, the listed profiles in `COMPOSE_PROFILES` will be activated and used.

### CMS Configuration

#### Drupal

##### Milvus Vector Database Provider for Drupal AI

1. `composer require drupal/ai_vdb_provider_milvus`
2. `drush en ai_vdb_provider_milvus`
3. Configure the module at `/admin/config/ai/vdb_providers/milvus` with the following settings:
